# network-config

\# Enterprise network configuration > Configure Claude Code for enterprise environments with proxy servers, custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication. Claude Code supports various enterprise network and security configurations through environment variables. This includes routing traffic through corporate proxy servers, trusting custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and authenticating with mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) certificates for enhanced security. All environment variables shown on this page can also be configured in \[\`settings.json\`\](/en/settings). \## Proxy configuration ### Environment variables Claude Code respects standard proxy environment variables: \`\`\`bash theme={null} # HTTPS proxy (recommended) export HTTPS\_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com:8080 # HTTP proxy (if HTTPS not available) export HTTP\_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080 # Bypass proxy for specific requests - space-separated format export NO\_PROXY="localhost 192.168.1.1 example.com .example.com" # Bypass proxy for specific requests - comma-separated format export NO\_PROXY="localhost,192.168.1.1,example.com,.example.com" # Bypass proxy for all requests export NO\_PROXY="\*" \`\`\` Claude Code does not support SOCKS proxies. \### Basic authentication If your proxy requires basic authentication, include credentials in the proxy URL: \`\`\`bash theme={null} export HTTPS\_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080 \`\`\` Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts. Use environment variables or secure credential storage instead. For proxies requiring advanced authentication (NTLM, Kerberos, etc.), consider using an LLM Gateway service that supports your authentication method. \## Custom CA certificates If your enterprise environment uses custom CAs for HTTPS connections (whether through a proxy or direct API access), configure Claude Code to trust them: \`\`\`bash theme={null} export NODE\_EXTRA\_CA\_CERTS=/path/to/ca-cert.pem \`\`\` ## mTLS authentication For enterprise environments requiring client certificate authentication: \`\`\`bash theme={null} # Client certificate for authentication export CLAUDE\_CODE\_CLIENT\_CERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem # Client private key export CLAUDE\_CODE\_CLIENT\_KEY=/path/to/client-key.pem # Optional: Passphrase for encrypted private key export CLAUDE\_CODE\_CLIENT\_KEY\_PASSPHRASE="your-passphrase" \`\`\` ## Network access requirements Claude Code requires access to the following URLs: \* \`api.anthropic.com\` - Claude API endpoints \* \`claude.ai\` - WebFetch safeguards \* \`statsig.anthropic.com\` - Telemetry and metrics \* \`sentry.io\` - Error reporting Ensure these URLs are allowlisted in your proxy configuration and firewall rules. This is especially important when using Claude Code in containerized or restricted network environments. ## Additional resources \* \[Claude Code settings\](/en/settings) \* \[Environment variables reference\](/en/settings#environment-variables) \* \[Troubleshooting guide\](/en/troubleshooting)
