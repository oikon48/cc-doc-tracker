\# Claude Code overview > Learn about Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before. ## Get started in 30 seconds Prerequisites: \* A \[Claude.ai\](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or \[Claude Console\](https://console.anthropic.com/) account \*\*Install Claude Code:\*\* \`\`\`bash theme={null} curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash \`\`\` \`\`\`bash theme={null} brew install --cask claude-code \`\`\` \`\`\`powershell theme={null} irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex \`\`\` \`\`\`bash theme={null} npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code \`\`\` Requires \[Node.js 18+\](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) \*\*Start using Claude Code:\*\* \`\`\`bash theme={null} cd your-project claude \`\`\` You'll be prompted to log in on first use. That's it! \[Continue with Quickstart (5 mins) →\](/en/quickstart) See \[advanced setup\](/en/setup) for installation options or \[troubleshooting\](/en/troubleshooting) if you hit issues. \*\*New VS Code Extension (Beta)\*\*: Prefer a graphical interface? Our new \[VS Code extension\](/en/vs-code) provides an easy-to-use native IDE experience without requiring terminal familiarity. Simply install from the marketplace and start coding with Claude directly in your sidebar. \## What Claude Code does for you \* \*\*Build features from descriptions\*\*: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works. \* \*\*Debug and fix issues\*\*: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix. \* \*\*Navigate any codebase\*\*: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with \[MCP\](/en/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack. \* \*\*Automate tedious tasks\*\*: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI. ## Why developers love Claude Code \* \*\*Works in your terminal\*\*: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love. \* \*\*Takes action\*\*: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? \[MCP\](/en/mcp) lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use \*your\* custom developer tooling. \* \*\*Unix philosophy\*\*: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. \`tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"\` \*works\*. Your CI can run \`claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"\`. \* \*\*Enterprise-ready\*\*: Use the Claude API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade \[security\](/en/security), \[privacy\](/en/data-usage), and \[compliance\](https://trust.anthropic.com/) is built-in. ## Next steps See Claude Code in action with practical examples Step-by-step guides for common workflows Solutions for common issues with Claude Code Add Claude Code to your IDE \## Additional resources Create custom AI agents with the Claude Agent SDK Configure Claude Code with Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI Customize Claude Code for your workflow Learn about CLI commands and controls Clone our development container reference implementation Discover Claude Code's safeguards and best practices for safe usage Understand how Claude Code handles your data
